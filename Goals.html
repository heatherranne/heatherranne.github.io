<h2>
Travel
</h2>
I wan to see as much of this big, beutiful world as possible. Though there are a milling places I 
want to go, <ul> I am most eager to see Italy, Greece, Ireland, Alaska, and Bora Bora. <ul>

<h2>
A beautiful house, an even more beautiful location
</h2>

<ul>
I'm all about the white picket fence and the cozy fireplace in the den. 
I would love to settle down in a small New Hampshire town, surrounded by the woods, but not too far from the ocean. <ul>


<h2>
Funding my dreams
</h2>
With all of the (expensive) interests and goals I have for my life, I'll need a carreer with the 
flexibility and pay that allows me to pursue them. Though I'm 100% sure about what path I'd like 
to take, I'm very interested in real estate. <ul>

I am aware that you do not need a college degree in order to become a real estate agent, my Bussiness
Administration degree will allow me the freedom to work for myself rather than split my commissions with a broker. </ul>
