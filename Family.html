As high school sweethearts, we've had the past 6 years to make a lot of 
memories together and start a small family of our own. 
Together we have 3 cats; Judith, Gary, and their baby Bruce, and a Bernese Moutaian dog 
named Autumn Paddy-Paws. <ul>

I'll always be a Gorrell, but now I get to be a Worster! <ul>
